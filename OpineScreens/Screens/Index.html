                                PM Abbasi inaugurates first 'dirty cargo' terminal, says democracy necessary for development
                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi formally inaugurated the country’s first dirty cargo terminal at Port Qasim near Karachi on Saturday.

                                Sponsored by the Marine Group of Companies, the Pakistan International Bulk Terminal (PIBT) handles coal, clinker and cement cargo at the Port Qasim.

                                Addressing a ceremony organised on this occasion, the prime minister said Pakistan had required this terminal for a long time. Few terminals around the world could match the quality of the PIBT, "the terminal of the future", he said.

                                He said the terminal is environment-friendly and would help kickstart exports of cement and clinker from Pakistan.

                                "This is the lone government in the history of Pakistan which started projects and also completed them before the end of its term," Abbasi said.

                                He said the PML-N government had inherited a number of crises when it started its term in 2013, but the government had made electricity available by starting projects to produce more than 10,000MW in the last four years. The government has also ensured that gas is provided to each gas consumer.

                                "After December, people will get whatever amount of gas they require, and new connections will also be issued," he said.

                                Abbasi emphasised that the country would not develop if there was no democracy. He said democracy is a process and its flaws will be eliminated only if the process moves forward.

                                "A high growth, low inflation scenario exists in the country today," the premier said, vowing to resolve all the challenges faced by the economy.

                                Earlier, upon his arrival in Karachi for a day-long visit, the premier was received by Sindh Governor Mohammad Zubair and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.

                                Built at a cost of $285 million, the PIBT began commercial operations in May. The dedicated terminal can handle 12m tonnes of coal per annum.

                                Due to state-of-the-art mechanisation and full automation, the PIBT can handle coal, clinker and cement in two days compared to seven days by a coal cargo ship with similar tonnage at the Karachi Port.

                                The Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Ltd, under a 30-year built-operate-and-transfer agreement with the Port Qasim Authority, has built its own jetty equipped with two coal ship unloading cranes and one cement/clinker loading crane.

                                US, Pakistan to hold frank talks, says interior minister
                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                WASHINGTON: Interior Min­i­ster Ahsan Iqbal has said that the United States and Pakistan will have a detailed and frank discussion on all relevant issues when US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visits Islamabad later this month.

                                The minister’s remarks came hours after US President Donald Trump expressed his desire to build a much better relationship with Pakistan, also hinting that the two allies were already cooperating with each other on many fronts.

                                This was the second reconciliatory message for Pakistan from the US president in the last three days. In the recent past, Mr Trump has been very critical of Pakistan and in his Aug 21 speech, he also hinted at the possibility of imposing new sanctions on the country if it did not change the policies that Washington says encourage militancy in the region.

                                Trump says Pakistan’s cooperation is a sign it’s honouring America’s wishes for it to do more

                                But this changed on Thursday when working on a US tip Pakistan rescued an American woman, Caitlan Cole, and her Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, from the clutches of the militants.

                                “This is a positive moment for our country’s relationship with Pakistan,” said President Trump while announcing the rescue at a White House event. “The Pakistani government’s cooperation is a sign that it is honouring America’s wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region.”

                                On Friday evening, Mr Trump sent out another tweet, indicating that the US-Pakistan cooperation was deeper than one rescue operation. “Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders, I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts,” he said.

                                Mr Iqbal, when asked to comment on Mr Trump’s statement after a Friday night event at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, said the United States and Pakistan have had a strong relationship for the last 70 years and both desire to continue these close ties.

                                He acknowledged that US-Pakistan relations had strained considerably after Mr Trump announced his new South Asia strategy on Aug. 21, giving India a greater role in Afghanistan.

                                “Both sides are now taking steps to mend this relationship. Secretary Tillerson is scheduled to visit Islamabad soon. We will have frank and detailed discussions on all key issues and I hope that this visit will be successful,” Mr Iqbal said.

                                He repeated his earlier suggestion that the US should deal with Pakistan as an important sovereign state and “not through India’s or Afghanistan’s prism”.

                                The first effort to improve bilateral ties was taken last month, when Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi met US Vice President Mike Pence and both leaders agreed to continue the reconciliation process.

                                Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif visited Washington and met Secretary Tillerson and this week the US sent a multi-departmental delegation to Islamabad for further talks.

                                In his address at the Embassy Forum, the minister highlighted the economic gains and the security successes of Pakistan, achieved in the last four years.

                                “There’s not been a single case of corruption in the last four years,” said Mr Iqbal. “We are working to end corruption.”

                                He said the current government’s prudent fiscal policies had led to a 5.3 per cent annual growth rate and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor would further increase the growth rate by generating business opportunities for foreign investors.

                                Mr Iqbal said the country’s security situation had also improved considerably after successful military operations in the tribal areas as well as other parts of the country.
